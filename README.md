# NLP
### 1. Introduction
The objective of this project was to leverage the capabilities of the HuggingFace Transformers library and Gradio.io to develop an interactive Natural Language Processing (NLP) application. The application involved utilizing HuggingFace's powerful pre-trained models and Gradio's user-friendly interface to build a Language Model (LLM) based application for a specific NLP task.

2. Tasks

2.1 Learning Phase
The project began with a thorough review of the lecture materials and slides covering the HuggingFace API and the integration of Gradio.io for web-based NLP applications. This included exploring various Python notebook examples provided as supplementary material to reinforce the understanding of both APIs.

2.2 Pipeline Selection
An important task was to select an Interface Pipeline that wasn't covered extensively in class. This involved exploring the available tasks using the PIPELINE_REGISTRY from the HuggingFace library to identify a suitable task for the project. The goal was to choose a task that would demonstrate the versatility and applicability of the HuggingFace Transformers library beyond the commonly discussed tasks like sentiment analysis or named entity recognition.

2.3 Implementation
Following the selection of a suitable task, a Python notebook was created to showcase the usage of the chosen pipeline. This involved:

Demonstrating the usage of the selected pipeline with sample examples.
Modifying the default model of the pipeline by selecting another appropriate model from the HuggingFace model repository. This was done by searching for keywords related to the chosen task and evaluating the performance of the new model with example inputs.
2.4 Gradio App Development
The final task was to develop a Gradio App to visualize the selected pipeline. This involved integrating the chosen NLP task into a user-friendly web interface using Gradio.io. The app allowed users to interact with the NLP model in real-time, inputting text or other relevant data to observe the model's predictions or outputs through an intuitive graphical interface.

3. Conclusion
In conclusion, this project provided hands-on experience in utilizing cutting-edge NLP technologies offered by HuggingFace Transformers and Gradio.io to develop an interactive application. The combination of powerful pre-trained models with a user-friendly interface opens up exciting possibilities for building practical NLP applications with ease. The project not only reinforced the understanding of these APIs but also demonstrated their potential to create impactful and accessible NLP solutions.
